  <summary>Stream movies and TV shows from Jellyfin</summary>

  <description>
    <p>Delfin is a native client for the Jellyfin media server. It features a fast and clean
      interface to stream your media in an embedded MPV-based video player.</p>

    <p>Delfin currently supprts streaming movies and TV shows from your library. The video
      player
      supports the Intro Skipper plugin for skipping intros automatically, and the Jellyscrub
      plugin
      to show thumbnails while scrubbing through videos.</p>

    <p>This is an early release, you may run into bugs or missing features. Delfin does not come
      with any media, you must connect to a Jellyfin server. Plugins must be installed and
      configured on your server to be available from Delfin.</p>

    <release version="0.2.0" date="2023-12-04">
      <description>
        <p>This release adds several new subtitle features, some new video player features,
          and some minor changes and bug fixes.</p>

        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>External subtitles (that aren't embedded in the video stream) will now be
            available</li>
          <li>Add subtitle style preferences, allowing you to configure subtitle font,
            colours, size, and position</li>
          <li>Add keybindings (comma and period) to seek through videos frame-by-frame</li>
          <li>By default, the video player controls will be shown when you move the mouse,
            and hidden a few seconds after you stop moving the mouse</li>
          <li>Add a preference that lets you configure left mouse click to toggle the
            video player controls, instead of using mouse movement</li>
          <li>Add a preference to manually change the app's language</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Changes and bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fix a crash when trickplay thumbnails are missing</li>
          <li>Use a higher resolution thumbnail while counting down to the next episode</li>

          <li>Improve grouping of plugin preferences</li>
          <li>Limit the library to only show the user's first five collections.
            Previously, users with a large number of collections would run into UI
            issues. A better fix that allows access to all libraries is coming, but for
            now you can reorder your libraries in Jellyfin's settings to make them
            accessible.</li>
          <li>Fix links in the preferences not opening when you click on them</li>
        </ul>
